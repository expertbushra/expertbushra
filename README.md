##### I' m passionate about learning and making deiffernce using data

* to understand cause and effect.
* to extract decision making insight.
* to help machiens learn.
* to make he world a better place.

##### Check out my Data Science Portfolio consisting of my Case Studies with Codes, Papers, Blogs, and Videos in the field of:

- Data Science (ML & DL)
- Data Analytics
- Finance
- Healthcare

### Languages and Tools:

As a result of my perpetual curiosity, I have practical experience with a wide range of technologies including:

Python â€¢ R  â€¢ Javascript â€¢ SQL â€¢ PHP â€¢ HTML5 â€¢ CSS â€¢ Bootstrap â€¢ NodeJS â€¢ Jquery â€¢ MySQL â€¢ MongoDB â€¢ Scikit-Learn  â€¢ Pandas â€¢ Numpy

## For use with concepts such as:

Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Analytics, Statistical Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Data Visualization, Database Systems & Information Modelling â€¢ Software Engineering â€¢ Web Application Development, and more!

Thankfully, Iâ€™m not a cat.

## Certificates Iâ€™ve completed:

To feed my hunger for learning, I take online courses for different Data Science topics and work independently on projects in my free time. 
Some of them include:

* _Applied Data Science I: Scientific Computing & Python by **World Quant University - The Data Incubator_ 
* _Applied Data Science II: Machine Learning & Statistical Analysis by **World Quant University - The Data Incubator  
* _Data Scince Math Skills by **Duke University - Coursera  
* _Machine Learning by 
* _Data Science Specialization by **IBM - Coursera
